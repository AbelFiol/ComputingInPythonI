# ComputingInPythonI
This repository contains code and notes from Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming by GTx.

The course covers the basics of programming in Python, including how code is interpreted, how to work with variables, and how to use mathematical and logical operators.

By the end, I was able to write simple Python programs that solve real world problems using core programming concepts.
